## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program

Overview
---
In this project,I've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs,model is trained and validated so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained,I tried out on Indian Traffic signs to check accuracy of model.


The Project
---
The steps involved in  this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Dataset and Repository

Dataset can be downloaded from below link.It is a pickled dataset in which is resized the images imto 32x32. It contains a training, validation and test set.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project
